I don't want to infer too much as there are several reasons that the numbers may be showing this way, but this initial overview suggests that the Google Play audience is more interested in practical apps than the Apple audience, as a larger percentage of the apps on the Google Play store cater to these types of users.\n",

However, since I only care about the relative numbers and not the exact ones, the analysis will still be valid."

    "## Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the data, I recommend developing a reference app to put on the Google Play and Apple Stores.  Reference has the second highest level of average user engagement among english free apps on the Apple store, and while the insights from the Google Play store are not as conclusive - the data shows that the audience is there to support a multiple stage rollout across the two platforms.  Additionally, building a competative product in this space will likely be easier than trying to compete with the likes of Apple Maps, Spotify, and Instagram in the other high user engagement Genres.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other big plus to moving in this direction, is that we won't have to deal with the same level of complexity that we would with the other top audiences.  Breaking into Navigation, Weather, or Finance would likely entail having to connect to complex and expensive APIs, Music or Book apps would require us to aquire IP rights (and the ads on these types of apps are usually viewed as invasive by users), and the popular food and drink apps are primarly owned by restauraunt chains which is out of the scope of our orgnaization.\n",
    "\n",
    "While reference isnt very sexy, building a highly functional dictionary, thesaurus, or translation app may be the fastest way to building a large, loyal and engaged audience to support the organization's ad revenues.\n"
